- Our game:
  - We developed TelerikAlumnus for both entertainment and educational purposes.
  Our player (named **Coki**), yearns to become a successful developer and gain the highest *Rank* in the game hierarchy.
  The Rank levels are:
     - Entered Coder
     - Fellow Coder
     - Master Coder
     
    To rank up Coki goes through different tasks, completes assignments, works on bigger projects etc.
    He has several stats which, are changed both up and sometimes down when he gains more experience.
    He also enjoys his free time - having rest or doing leisure activities, which help release the stress level.
    He can also get an advice from upper Rank Coders during the game play, some of the names you might find familiar.
    Any resemblance to actual persons, is purely coincidental :)
   
    The three basic skills are *coding skills*, *soft skill* and *algorithmic thinking*. Those help him solve the various tasks and assignments.
    He can equip various HW tools or use faster Internet connection in order to boost the skills up.
    During the game, **Coki** will go through several hardships, that put his abilities to test. He would be given different Tasks from
    different categories, which need different skill levels to be completed. If **Coki** manages to complete the task within the given time
    limit, he gains experience, so that he can rank his level up. If he fails he might lose experience too.
   
    Once he has enough experience he has the chance to meet **Joro the Rabbit** himself, who makes **Coki**
    choose whether he would rank up or .. well, something else, but let's not spoil the surprise :)
    
    Sounds fun, yeah? Well, let's play!
