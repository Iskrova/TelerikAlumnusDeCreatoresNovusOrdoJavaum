# TelerikAlumnusDeCreatoresNovusOrdoJavaum

TelerikAlumnusDeCreatoresNovusOrdoJavaum is a single palyer game, developed by the team **Black Widow**. This is our first team project 
as *Telerik Academy* students. Our git repository URL: https://github.com/Iskrova/TelerikAlumnusDeCreatoresNovusOrdoJavaum.git

- Our team members are:
   - Petroslav Angelov - **pangelov**
   - Radoslav Dimitrov - **markov.r**
   - Penyo Kolev       - **kugaev**
   - Mariya Iskrova    - **IskrovaMariya**
  
- Our purpose:

  - We have developed a game, which is provided for both entertainment and educational purpose. Our player, we decided to name him 
  **Coki**, wants to become a successful developer, getting the highest possible *Rank* in this game hierarchy. 
  The Rank levels are as follows:
     - Entered Coder
     - Fellow Coder
     - Master Coder
     
    However, before that, he needs to get through several tasks, completing his assignments, solving tasks, working on project and so on...
    You already got the idea, right?! Our player have several stats which, he is supposed to level up or down in order to gain more 
    experience, enjoying his free time, resting or getting to differnt places, doing leisure activities etc. He also has the chance to get 
    some advice from upper Rank Level Coder representatives during the game play.
   
    Of course he has skills, which make him more proffessional at his work and they are as follows: *coding skills*, *soft skill* and 
    *algorithmic thinking*.
    During the game, **Coki** will go throuhg several hardships, testing his abilities. He would be given different Tasks to complete from
    different categories, which need diffent skill levels to be completed. If **Coki** manage to complete the task within the given time  
    limit, he gains some experience, so that he can rank his level up.
   
    When he has already gained some experience, luckily he has the chance to meet our friend **Joro the Rabbit**, who will provide **Coki** 
    with the chance to choose whether to rank up and become a beter proffesional or... something interesting and a little bit tricky 
    instead.
    
    Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Then, let's play! :)
